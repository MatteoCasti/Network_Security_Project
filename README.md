# Network_Security_Project

Network Security Project
 
A client-server connection where the client is a raspberry pi that takes data from IOT devices or an authorized user that may read the data.
We want to implement:
-	A firewall that blocks all connection to the server apart from the client
-	Protected transfer data
-	Communication channel between IOT devices and raspberry pi.
